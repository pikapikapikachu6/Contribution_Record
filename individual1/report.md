#### Details
In week2, my assigned XP role is tester. But that week is our project’s first week, we haven't produced any output, our work focused on understanding the project, meeting with clients to understand basic requirements, mutual understanding of team members, writing user stories and assignment of project XP roles. Thus, I don’t have any need to do the software testing. I transferred to this project group on Friday that week. I missed meeting with the client for the first time and writing the user stories. But after I joined the group, I immediately contacted the team members and had a meeting with team members that week Sunday.

During the meeting, I participated in writing scope, adding my information in contract and deed poll files, and created a new file to compile a list of questions that need to be communicated with the client in week3.

#### Details
In week3, I was assigned to a demo & poster role. During the tutorial, our group did one presentation to introduce our project’s basic information and each group member's role. As I was the demo & poster, I was the first one to introduce during the presentation and I am responsible for introducing the responsibilities of each team member. As always, we had a meeting with the client on Tuesday. During this meeting, I contributed to ask some more detailed questions about the client’s requirement using my prepared question list before. During this meeting, we learned more about the client's requirements.

Thus, in Thursday's group meeting, we improved our scope and user stories based on requirements modified. Then I and Lawrence uploaded all our user stories to the Jira board.

That week, during the group meeting, our group members designed the UI/UX together. Firstly, we planned to use Figma to draw the UI together, but we found this to be inefficient. Because each group member used different tools to draw UI before, we are not familiar with Figma. Then, we decided to draw the UI/UX draft on the whiteboard together and then Andrew is responsible for rendering the sketch on the Figma. I contributed to participating in designing processing and used my previous front-end developing experience to recommend some components design.

Because I was focused on web development before, I haven’t learnt or tried to develop an iOS app. Thus, I need to learn some ios developing knowledge and need to prepare the ios developing environment. In week3, I tried to research how to develop an ios app on the Windows or Ubuntu system because my laptop systems are them.  Finally I found that I must use MacOS to do the development.  
And in week3, I researched a lot and recommended using firebase in our project. Firebase provides detailed documentation and cross-platform SDKs to help us develop and ship apps on iOS. It is a platform for creating mobile and web applications.
