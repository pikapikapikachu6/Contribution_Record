### Details
In week2, my assigned XP role is tester. But that week is our project’s first week, we haven't produced any output, our work focused on understanding the project, meeting with clients to understand basic requirements, mutual understanding of team members, writing user stories and assignment of project XP roles. Thus, I don’t have any need to do the software testing. I transferred to this project group on Friday that week. I missed meeting with the client for the first time and writing the user stories. But after I joined the group, I immediately contacted the team members and had a meeting with team members that week Sunday. ![contact](./week2/contact.png) 
During the meeting, I participated in writing scope, adding my information in contract and deed poll files, and created a new file to compile a list of questions that need to be communicated with the client in week3. ![question list](./week2/question_list.png) 
Also, I participated in preparing the Week3 Project Plan & Roles Allocation Presentation including making PPT. ![PPT](./week2/presentation_ppt.png)
