        In week 5, as the role of tracking and managing XP, I created a project on the Zentao platform to facilitate the documentation of functional tests. Then I learned something about functional testing and learned how to use the Zentao platform. Finally I wrote some test cases for functional tests.
    - **week 6 and week7**  
        From week 6 to week 7, as the role of tester in week 6 and the role of Customer Liaison, I finished writing all the test cases for function testing on the Zentao platform. And do some research on how to do the other testing in our project. 
    - **week 8**  
        In week 8, as the role of tester, I was supposed to start doing testing such as unit testing. But I finished the “like” feature this week because the base feature for our group had not yet been implemented.

## The extent of the work
### Technical part

On the Zentao platform, I can create each test case clearly. It includes each test case running prerequisite, the test cases belonging to which modules, the testing type, the priority, the test case current status and so on information. And It shows each step clearly, when executing the test case, can directly record the result when clicking the “run” button. It can record each step's running result such as “pass”, “fail”, “blocked” and so on.
