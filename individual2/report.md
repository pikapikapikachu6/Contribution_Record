# Lavender Individual Report (week5 - week8)

## A clear statement of work done

### Summary of Work Done 
- **Brief Summary of XP roles**  

| Week | Work Planned |
|----------|:-------------:|
| week 5 | Tracking & Manager |
| week 6 | Tester |
| week 7 | Customer Liaison |
| week 8 | Tester | 

- **Technical tasks and roles**  
    - **week 5**  
        In the week 5, as the role of tracking and managing XP, I created a project on the Zentao platform to facilitate the documentation of functional tests. Then I learned something about functional testing and learned how to use the Zentao platform. Finally I wrote some test cases for functional tests.

    - **week 6 and week 7**  
        From the week 6 to week 7, as the role of tester in week 6 and the role of Customer Liaison, I finished writing all the test cases for function testing on the Zentao platform. And do some research on how to do the other testing in our project. 

    - **week 8**  
        In the week 8, as the role of tester, I was supposed to start doing testing such as unit testing. But I finished the “like” feature this week because the base feature for our group had not yet been implemented.

- **Other responsibilities**
    - **week 5**  
        In the week 5, act as a tracker and manage the XP role. It was my responsibility and duty to call the group to meet, record the meeting, assign tasks and work with everyone to complete them. Therefore, during the week, I contributed to documenting the task requirements for week 5, called the meeting, prepared before the meeting, wrote three meeting minutes including one meeting with the client and two meetings with our group, wrote the to-do list, assigned tasks to each member and did the section on testing both when writing the report and when doing the presentation, and finally completed the 360 degree contribution review.

    - **week 6**   
        In week 6, in my role as a tester, I completed the section of the group report and presentation on testing. I also prepared for the presentation with the client in week 7 by making the PPT slides on the testing part and preparing the presentation transcript on the testing part. Also I contributed to writing the group contract from week 6 to week 13. 

    - **week 7**  
        In week 7, my role as Customer Liaison, I contacted the client a week in advance of the meeting to set up a time and address for the presentation about the week. During the presentation, I made a recorded contribution. And after the meeting with the client, I compiled and recorded the feedback from the client. 
        
    - **week 8**  
        In week 8, my role was that of a tester, but I contributed to the group by contacting the client and writing the progressive report. I contacted the client and offered to suspend a client meeting because there was no new intuitive page functionality available to her at the moment. And I started preparing and writing our progressive report.

## The extent of the work
### week 5
As the Tracking & Manager, during the tutorial, I contributed to recording the week5 tasks requirements and shared them with my group on Slack.   
[*week5_requirements*]

As the manager, before the meeting, I contributed to making some preparations including declaring the group meeting content and creating the file on the google drive to let our group work together.  
[*meeting_preparations*]    
![meeting_preparations](./week5/meeting_prepare.png) 

As the manager, I contributed to writing the week5' wiki and recording three meeting minutes including one meeting with the client and two meetings with our group. During the meeting with the client, we showed our progress and got feedback from the client that all is well done but we need to show more features in the next meeting. During our first group meeting, we assigned each member tasks about group report and presentation and then wrote the group report together. During the second group meeting, we finished our presentation slides and recorded the presentation.

### week 6
As a tester, from week 6 to week 7, I contributed to writing all the test cases for the function testing. I separated the test cases into different modules based on different pages in our app. And then wrote detailed test cases based on the functional points of each page.

### week 8
As a group member, I contributed in contacting the client to cancel client meetings, as we can't present more intuitive features at this time.
[*contact_client*]   
![contact_client](./week8/cancel.png)

As a group member, I contributed to finishing the "like" feature. My logist is that when the user click the "like" button, then if initial status is empty then turn "like" which means the button will change colour and the total number of like will add one, and if the initial status is "like" then the turn cancel status which means the button will change to no colour and the total number of like will delete one. And each step will go through the process of getting the current number of "like" from the database, change the native status and number, and set the new number of "like" to the database.

## Quality of technical work done
I contributed to chosing to use zentao platform to ensures that our function testings are complete and viewable. On the Zentao platform, I can create each test case clearly. It includes each test case running prerequisite, the test cases belonging to which modules, the testing type, the priority, the test case current status and so on information. And It shows each step clearly, when executing the test case, can directly record the result when clicking the “run” button. It can record each step's running result such as “pass”, “fail”, “blocked” and so on    
[*quality_zentao*]    
![quality_zentao](./other/quality_zentao.png)

I contributed to choosing to use Equivalence partitioning and Boundary testing two methods to ensure that our test cases coverage is good. For example, we write a test case where some boundary value that the input node must at least exist one. Using these techniques can improve our test cases quality and can make our test cases more comprehensive and complete in design.

## Other contributions to group processes
I contributed to attending meetings every time. I have not missed a group meeting or meeting with a client. And I contributed to recording feedback from every meeting with clients.   
[*feedback*]    
![feedback](./other/feedback.png)

I contributed to completing assigned tasks on time and responding to messages promptly. For example, I was assigned to send an email to the client, then I will finish immediately. And when other members need some, I will reply and provide quickly.
[*on_time*]

I contributed to using my experience to help our project in the testing part. I have some software testing experience before but they are not iOS application related. Thus, I also need to do some research on iOS testing. But compared to our group members, I may be more familiar with the testing, then in group report, presentations, I did the testing part. And I was assigned the XP roles as the tester more frequently.
