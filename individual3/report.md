# Lavender Individual Report (week9 - week10)

## A clear statement of work done

### Summary of Work Done 
- **Brief Summary of XP roles**  

| Week | Work Planned |
|----------|:-------------:|
| week 9 | Bitbucket Expert |
| week 10 | Report writer |

- **Technical tasks and roles**  
    - **week 9**   
        In week 9, my role was that of a Bitbucket expert, and to avoid code conflicts, I created a new branch in Bitbucket and submitted my code for the "like" function. As the project team member, I set up the project unit testing environment.

    - **week 10**  
        In week 10, my role was that of report writer, and I assembled and worked with my teammates to complete the week11 progressive report. As a team member, I completed the first round of functional testing, testing a total of 55 test cases, passing 33 and failing 22. The reason for this was that our development was not complete and some of our code had not been code reviewed and therefore had not been merged into the master branch.

- **Other responsibilities**
    - **week 9**
        In week 9, my role was that of Bitbucket expert, and I followed the Bitbucket commit process to make sure our project had no code merge conflicts. I participated in a tutorial class on Tuesday, where we worked on code review and merging. And I supervised the person in charge to finish the wiki for week 9. As a team member, I researched how to write XCtest.

    - **week 10**   
        In week 10, my role was that of report writer, I finished the week11 progressive report together with group members. And I generated a test report including the first functional testing test cases including each test case's name, testing steps, the result and so on. As a team member, I researched how to write XCtest.

## Quality of technical work done
I contributed to chosing to use zentao platform to ensures that our function testings are complete and viewable. On the Zentao platform, I can create each test case clearly. It includes each test case running prerequisite, the test cases belonging to which modules, the testing type, the priority, the test case current status and so on information. And It shows each step clearly, when executing the test case, can directly record the result when clicking the “run” button. It can record each step's running result such as “pass”, “fail”, “blocked” and so on

I contributed to choosing to use Equivalence partitioning and Boundary testing two methods to ensure that our test cases coverage is good. For example, we write a test case where some boundary value that the input node must at least exist one. Using these techniques can improve our test cases quality and can make our test cases more comprehensive and complete in design.

## Other contributions to group processes
I contributed to attending meetings every time. I have not missed a group meeting or meeting with a client. And I contributed to recording feedback from every meeting with clients.

I contributed to completing assigned tasks on time and responding to messages promptly. For example, I was assigned to send an email to the client, then I will finish immediately. And when other members need some, I will reply and provide quickly.

I contributed to using my experience to help our project in the testing part. I have some software testing experience before but they are not iOS application related. Thus, I also need to do some research on iOS testing. But compared to our group members, I may be more familiar with the testing, then in group report, presentations, I did the testing part. And I was assigned the XP roles as the tester more frequently.
